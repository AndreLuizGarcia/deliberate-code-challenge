## â˜• React Coding Challenge

This repositorie it's a coding challenge that was suggested by Deliberate.ai
The instructions are based [here](https://gitlab.com/join-deliberate/frontend-challenge)

## What was used in this project?

This project was developed with React library, have unit tests and is integrated (manually for now) with [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io/) to check vulnerabilities.

## Next steps and considerations

For this project be more awesome than it already is we can follow some roadmap like this:

- [ ] Improve layout to offer a better user experiencie (lol)
- [ ] Implement a skeleton component to use when the requests are beeing done to offer a better feedback to the user
- [ ] Implement better logs, notifications and feedback to the user when something went wrong
- [ ] The API doesn't have pagination, so to offer a better experience to the user maybe it's a possibility do this in the frontend
- [ ] Section part of API response has a content with HTML. It's necessary to understand better the patterns that HTML tags it's beeing receive to style it in a better way
- [ ] Improve unit tests to get 100% of coverage. - Today is almost there
- [ ] Implement E2E tests. A suggestion is use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to implement this kind of test.
- [ ] If the number of generic components grow or maybe if the project will have a design system it's nice to document this design system with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
